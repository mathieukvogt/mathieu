              <h3>let</h3>
              <p>A variable in programming is a storage location identified by a name, which can hold data that may be modified during the execution of a program. Variables are used to store values so that these values can be used and manipulated throughout the program. They can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, objects, and more. Variables enable developers to write flexible and dynamic code by providing a way to reference and operate on data without hard-coding values directly into the program.

                <br><br>In JavaScript, the let keyword is used to declare a variable that is block-scoped, which means it is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it is declared. This contrasts with the older var keyword, which declares a variable globally or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope. The let keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) to provide better control over variable scope and to avoid issues related to variable hoisting that are associated with var.
                
                <br><br>When you declare a variable using let, it is not hoisted to the top of its enclosing block. Instead, it is hoisted to the top of the block but not initialized, which means it cannot be accessed until the execution reaches the line of code where it is declared. This behavior is known as the "temporal dead zone" and helps prevent errors that can occur when variables are used before they are defined.
                
                <br><br>For example, in a block, trying to access a variable declared with let before its declaration line results in a ReferenceError. Once the declaration line is reached, the variable can be accessed and used. The let keyword also prevents the redeclaration of the same variable within the same scope, providing an additional layer of error checking. Attempting to redeclare a variable with let in the same scope results in a SyntaxError, which helps to catch mistakes and enforce cleaner code practices.
                
                <br><br>Overall, the let keyword in JavaScript provides a way to declare variables that are confined to their block scope, reducing the likelihood of errors related to variable hoisting and redeclaration, and promoting better coding practices by encouraging the use of variables only within their intended context.</p>

              <h3>const</h3>
              <p>The `const` keyword in JavaScript is used to declare variables that are intended to be constant, meaning their values are not supposed to change after they are initialized. Similar to the `let` keyword, `const` creates block-scoped variables. This means that the variable declared with `const` is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it is defined, and cannot be accessed outside of that scope. 

                <br><br>When you declare a variable with `const`, it must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration. This is because `const` variables are read-only after they are assigned a value. Trying to declare a `const` variable without initializing it will result in a syntax error. Once assigned, the variable cannot be reassigned a new value, which helps enforce immutability at the variable level.
                
                <br><br>It's important to note that while the `const` keyword prevents reassignment of the variable itself, it does not make the value immutable. For example, if the value assigned to a `const` variable is an object or an array, the contents of that object or array can still be modified. This means you can change the properties of an object or elements of an array, but you cannot reassign the variable to a different object or array. 
                
                <br><br>Using `const` for variables that should remain unchanged helps improve code reliability and readability by signaling the intent that the variable's value should not be altered. It also reduces the risk of unintended side effects caused by variable reassignment. However, because `const` is block-scoped like `let`, it can only be accessed within the block it is declared in, and it cannot be redeclared within that same block. 
                
                <br><br>In summary, the `const` keyword in JavaScript is used to declare variables with a constant value that should not be reassigned. It provides block scope similar to `let` and enforces immutability for the variable binding itself, though not necessarily for the value it holds if that value is an object or array.</p>

              <h3>Addition (+)</h3>
              <p>In JavaScript, the + operator is used for two primary purposes: numeric addition and string concatenation. When used with numbers, + performs arithmetic addition to calculate their sum. For example, 5 + 3 results in 8 and 10 + 15 results in 25, while 7 + -2 adds a negative number to get 5. When used with strings, the + operator concatenates them into a single string. For instance, "Hello, " + "world!" produces "Hello, world!", and concatenating "Alice" and "Johnson" with a space results in "Alice Johnson". If you add a number to a string, the number is converted to a string and concatenated. For example, 10 + " apples" yields "10 apples", and "The result is " + (2 + 3) first evaluates the addition inside the parentheses to get 5, then concatenates it with the string to produce "The result is 5". A special case of addition is adding null to a number, where null is treated as 0, so 5 + null results in 5. Similarly, adding undefined to a string results in "undefined" as a string, so "Value is " + undefined produces "Value is undefined".</p>

              <h3>Subtraction (-)</h3>
              <p>In JavaScript, the - operator is used primarily for numeric subtraction. It subtracts the right operand from the left operand to yield a numerical result. If used with two numbers, such as 8 - 3, it calculates the difference, which is 5. Subtraction can also be applied to negative numbers, for instance, 10 - (-4) results in 14 as it effectively adds the absolute value of the negative number. When - is used with non-numeric types, JavaScript first tries to convert the operands to numbers. If one operand is a string and the other is a number, JavaScript attempts to convert the string to a number; for example, "10" - 5 results in 5 because "10" is converted to the number 10. If the string cannot be converted to a number, such as in "hello" - 5, the result is NaN (Not-a-Number). Additionally, subtracting null from a number results in the number itself, as null is converted to 0; for instance, 15 - null equals 15. However, subtracting undefined from a number results in NaN, as undefined cannot be converted to a number, so 10 - undefined yields NaN.</p>

              <h3>Multiplication (*)</h3>
              <p>In JavaScript, the * operator is used for numeric multiplication. It multiplies the two operands and returns the product. For example, using 5 * 3 results in 15, as it multiplies 5 by 3. The * operator also supports multiplication with floating-point numbers, where 2.5 * 4 results in 10.0. JavaScript handles cases where one or both operands are non-numeric values by attempting to convert them into numbers before performing the multiplication. If one operand is a string that represents a number, like "7", multiplying it by a number results in 7, as the string "7" is converted to the number 7. However, if the string cannot be converted to a number, such as "hello" * 3, the result is NaN (Not-a-Number). Additionally, multiplying null by a number treats null as 0, so null * 4 yields 0. When undefined is involved in multiplication with a number, the result is also NaN, as undefined cannot be converted to a number, so 5 * undefined results in NaN.</p>

              <h3>Division (/)</h3>
              <p>In JavaScript, the / operator is used for numeric division. It divides the left operand by the right operand and returns the quotient. For example, 10 / 2 results in 5, as it divides 10 by 2. The / operator supports division with both integers and floating-point numbers, such as 7.5 / 2 which results in 3.75. When one or both of the operands are non-numeric types, JavaScript attempts to convert them to numbers before performing the division. For instance, if one operand is a string that represents a number, like "8", dividing it by a number yields 4, since the string "8" is converted to the number 8. However, if the string cannot be converted to a number, such as "hello" / 2, the result is NaN (Not-a-Number). Additionally, dividing a number by null treats null as 0, so dividing by null results in Infinity or -Infinity depending on the sign of the dividend. For example, 10 / null yields Infinity, while -10 / null results in -Infinity. When undefined is used in division with a number, the result is NaN, as undefined cannot be converted to a number, so 5 / undefined results in NaN.</p>

              <h3>Remainder (%)</h3>
              <p>In JavaScript, the % operator is used to calculate the remainder of the division between two numbers. It performs a division operation and returns the remainder after the division. For example, 10 % 3 results in 1, as 10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1. The % operator works with both positive and negative numbers, where -10 % 3 results in -1, as it computes the remainder considering the sign of the dividend. When used with non-numeric values, JavaScript attempts to convert the operands to numbers before calculating the remainder. For instance, if one operand is a string that represents a number, like "9", the operation "9" % 4 yields 1, as "9" is converted to 9 and then the remainder of 9 divided by 4 is 1. If the string cannot be converted to a number, such as "hello" % 2, the result is NaN (Not-a-Number). Additionally, when null is used as an operand, null is treated as 0, so 10 % null yields NaN because division by 0 is undefined. When undefined is involved, the result of the operation is also NaN, as undefined cannot be converted to a number, so 5 % undefined results in NaN.</p>

              <h3>Increment (++)</h3>
              <p>In JavaScript, the ++ operator is used to increment a number by one. This operator can be applied in two ways: as a prefix (before the operand) or as a postfix (after the operand). When used as a prefix, such as ++x, the value of x is incremented before it is used in an expression. Conversely, when used as a postfix, such as x++, the value of x is incremented after its current value has been used in the expression. The ++ operator only affects numbers; when applied to non-numeric values, JavaScript attempts to convert them to numbers. For example, "5"++ converts "5" to 5 and increments it to 6. If the string cannot be converted to a number, such as "hello"++, it results in NaN (Not-a-Number). Applying the ++ operator to null treats null as 0, so null++ increments null to 1. However, applying the ++ operator to undefined results in NaN because undefined cannot be converted to a number, so undefined++ yields NaN.</p>

              <p>In JavaScript, the -- operator is used to decrement a number by one. This operator can be utilized in two distinct ways: as a prefix (before the operand) or as a postfix (after the operand). When used as a prefix, such as --x, the value of x is decremented before it is used in any expression. Conversely, when used as a postfix, such as x--, the value of x is decremented after its current value has been used. The -- operator operates exclusively on numbers; if applied to non-numeric values, JavaScript attempts to convert the operands to numbers before performing the decrement operation. For example, "5"-- converts the string "5" to 5 and decrements it to 4. If the string cannot be converted to a number, such as "hello"--, it results in NaN (Not-a-Number). When null is decremented, null is treated as 0, so null-- decrements null to -1. However, decrementing undefined results in NaN because undefined cannot be converted to a number, so undefined-- yields NaN.</p>
